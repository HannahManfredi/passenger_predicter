Time Series Forecasting for US Air Travel Using an LSTM-Based Model

# Things to Explore

- Sliding vs. Overlapping Window
  - If using Overlapping approach, how do you set overlap param? We defaulted to 1

# Objectives

- 3/23 Create a benchmark:
  -Exploring different options including: -[sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit (create train/test datasets)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html)
  - [Time-related feature engineering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_cyclical_feature_engineering.html)
  - [Lagged features for time series forecasting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_time_series_lagged_features.html)
  - [Linear regression for time series](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)
